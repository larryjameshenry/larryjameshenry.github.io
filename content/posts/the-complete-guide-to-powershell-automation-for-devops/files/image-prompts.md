Here are 3 distinct text-to-image prompts for the "The Complete Guide to PowerShell Automation for DevOps" article.

### 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
*   **Concept:** A dramatic, close-up perspective of a modern digital workspace. It focuses on the "bridge" between code and infrastructure, visualizing the PowerShell terminal as a futuristic control interface managing a complex server environment.
*   **Prompt:**
    > A cinematic, photorealistic close-up of a sleek computer monitor in a dark, modern control room. The screen displays glowing blue PowerShell script lines and a visual CI/CD pipeline graph with green success checkmarks. In the background, out of focus, are rows of server racks with soft cyan status lights. The lighting is dramatic and moody, emphasizing the screen's glow. Tech noir aesthetic, high detail, 8k resolution, depth of field, unreal engine 5 render style, cyber-security atmosphere --ar 16:9

### 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
*   **Concept:** A clean, metaphorical representation of "Object-Oriented Pipelines." It shows data not as messy text, but as smooth, polished 3D spheres (objects) flowing through translucent pipes and gears, symbolizing the clean automation flow described in the article.
*   **Prompt:**
    > 3D isometric render of a futuristic automation factory. Smooth, translucent glass tubes connect floating platforms. Glowing blue spheres representing data objects flow seamlessly through the tubes. The platforms feature stylized, matte-finish 3D shapes of gears, cloud icons, and server blocks. Soft, volumetrics studio lighting. Color palette of cool blues, white, and soft grey. Clean, modern, simplistic shapes similar to Spline 3D or Blender, high fidelity, abstract tech visualization --ar 16:9

### 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
*   **Concept:** A "blueprint" style vector illustration that emphasizes structure and cross-platform capability. It uses simple geometry to connect a central terminal command to various environments (Windows, Linux, Cloud), reflecting the "Glue Code" aspect of the guide.
*   **Prompt:**
    > a flat minimalist vector illustration on a clean white background. In the center is a simplified command-line terminal icon. Clean, thick circuit-board lines radiate outward from the terminal, connecting to simple geometric icons representing a cloud, a Linux penguin silhouette, and a server stack. Use a professional color palette of deep navy blue, electric blue, and slate grey. Clean lines, no gradients, technical diagram aesthetic, symmetrical composition, Adobe Illustrator style --ar 16:9
