**Headline:** Platform Engineering 101: Releasing Your Developers from "Ticket Ops" Hell

**Body:**
Are your developers drowning in operational overhead? Is every new service a ticket, a waiting game, and a custom configuration nightmare? The "Ticket Ops" model starves innovation and burns out your best engineers.

Our new guide, "Platform Engineering 101: Building Your First Internal Developer Platform (IDP)," offers a transformative approach. Learn how to treat your infrastructure as a self-service product, empowering developers with "Golden Paths" for seamless creation and deployment.

Key insights include:
*   **Defining the IDP:** Understanding the Portal, Orchestrator, and Infrastructure layers.
*   **The "Golden Path" Philosophy:** Providing opinionated, streamlined workflows for common tasks.
*   **Balancing Freedom & Standards:** Allowing "Off-Roading" while encouraging standardization.
*   **Building with Backstage:** A hands-on example of scaffolding a service with the leading open-source IDP portal.

It's time to scale from 10 to 1000 services without multiplying your Ops headcount. Empower your teams and accelerate delivery.
