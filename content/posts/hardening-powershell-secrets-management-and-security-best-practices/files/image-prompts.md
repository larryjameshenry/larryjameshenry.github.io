Here are 3 distinct text-to-image prompts tailored for your blog post on Hardening PowerShell and Secrets Management.

### 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
* **Concept:** A literal interpretation of "hardening" the code. A close-up, dramatic shot of a digital lock mechanism integrated into a command-line interface, symbolizing the transition from clear text to encrypted security. It uses the classic PowerShell blue/black color palette but elevates it with cinematic lighting.
* **Prompt:**
> Cinematic macro photography of a heavy, high-tech digital padlock reinforcing a wall of glowing blue computer code, dark metallic textures, dramatic side lighting, depth of field, cyber security concept, powershell terminal aesthetic, hyper-realistic, 8k resolution, unreal engine 5 render style, electric blue and deep charcoal colors --ar 16:9

### 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
* **Concept:** Represents the "pipeline" and "vault" aspect of the article. A clean, isometric view of data (represented by spheres or blocks) flowing through a secure checkpoint (the vault). This style is very popular in modern SaaS and dev tool marketing (like Stripe or Vercel).
* **Prompt:**
> Isometric 3D render of a secure automation pipeline, a glossy white cubic vault with a golden keyhole sitting on a platform, connected by smooth glass tubes carrying glowing data spheres, soft studio lighting, clean background, matte materials, soft shadows, blender 3d spline style, minimal and modern tech aesthetic, shades of cyan and slate grey --ar 16:9

### 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
* **Concept:** A symbolic representation suitable for a technical diagram or a clean hero image. It features a shield and a gear (automation) to visually summarize "Secure Automation." This style works well because it is not distracting and looks professional on high-DPI screens.
* **Prompt:**
> Minimalist flat vector art, dark mode tech illustration, a central icon combining a mechanical gear with a security shield, stylized circuit lines radiating outward, clean geometric shapes, deep navy blue background with neon green and white accents, precise linework, adobe illustrator style, technical diagram aesthetic --ar 16:9
