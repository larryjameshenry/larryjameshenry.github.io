# Image Prompts for "Accelerating Delivery: Advanced Techniques for CI/CD Optimization"

## 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
*   **Concept:** A high-tech server room or command center, stylized with blue and orange neon lighting, representing the speed and efficiency of an optimized pipeline. Focus on a glowing data stream or a "fast lane" in a digital highway.
*   **Prompt:** high quality, masterpiece, 8k resolution, sharp focus, photorealistic cinematic shot of a futuristic data center, glowing blue and orange neon cables forming a high-speed digital highway, motion blur indicating extreme speed, sleek server racks in the background, depth of field, detailed textures, --ar 16:9
*   **Negative Prompt:** text, watermark, blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly, bad anatomy, people, messy wires, glitch.

## 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
*   **Concept:** An isometric 3D view of a clean, modular pipeline. Blocks representing "Build," "Test," and "Deploy" are connected by smooth, flowing tubes. The "Parallel" section fans out into multiple glowing lines before converging back.
*   **Prompt:** high quality, masterpiece, 8k resolution, sharp focus, 3D isometric render of a software delivery pipeline, sleek white and glass floating blocks connected by glowing neon tubes, data packets flowing rapidly, soft studio lighting, clean background, Spline 3D style, --ar 16:9
*   **Negative Prompt:** text, watermark, blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly, jagged edges, noise, dark shadows.

## 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
