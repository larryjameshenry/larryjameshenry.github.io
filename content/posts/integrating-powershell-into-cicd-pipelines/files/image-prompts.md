Here are 3 distinct, high-quality text-to-image prompts for your "Integrating PowerShell into CI/CD Pipelines" blog post.

### 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
**Concept:**
A macro, close-up view of a futuristic server environment. The focus is on a glass terminal interface displaying glowing PowerShell syntax, blending the physical hardware of the server room with the digital logic of the pipeline. This represents the "bridge" between infrastructure and code.

**Prompt:**
> Cinematic macro photography of a sleek glass digital interface in a dark modern server room, glowing cyan PowerShell script syntax floating on the screen, background features rows of out-of-focus server rack lights with deep blue bokeh, dramatic rim lighting, high tech atmosphere, photorealistic, 8k resolution, depth of field, cyberpunk aesthetic --ar 16:9

### 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
**Concept:**
An abstract 3D representation of a "pipeline." Smooth, geometric shapes (cubes or spheres) representing code commits travel along a glowing track or tube, passing through a "gateway" structure that symbolizes the PowerShell automation step. Clean, soft, and modern.

**Prompt:**
> 3D isometric render of a clean digital automation pipeline, glossy white and blue geometric cubes moving along a floating glass track, passing through a glowing hexagonal checkpoint gate, soft studio lighting, pastel blue and neon teal color palette, abstract representation of continuous integration, smooth textures, Blender 3D style, clay render finish, minimal background --ar 16:9

### 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
**Concept:**
A flat, schematic design suitable for a technical diagram. It features a central command-line terminal icon acting as the "hub" or "glue," with clean circuit-board style lines connecting it to cloud and server icons. Professional and symbolic.

**Prompt:**
> Minimalist vector illustration of a DevOps workflow, central command terminal icon connected by clean white circuit lines to cloud infrastructure symbols, flat design, deep navy blue background, electric blue and white accents, tech schematic style, high contrast, clean lines, corporate tech art, 2D vector graphics --ar 16:9
