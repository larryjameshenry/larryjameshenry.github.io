Based on the article "Testing Infrastructure with Pester: Beyond Unit Tests," here are 3 distinct text-to-image prompts designed for your technical audience.

### 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
**Concept:** A dramatic, high-tech visualization of the "Infrastructure" aspect. It features a close-up of a server rack in a modern data center, but with a digital overlay that emphasizes the "testing" and "code" aspectΓÇöbridging the gap between hardware and script.

**Prompt:**
```text
Cinematic close-up photography of modern server rack blades in a dark data center, illuminated by cool blue status LEDs, overlaid with a floating holographic interface displaying a PowerShell terminal window with scrolling green text and bright "PASSED" verification checkmarks, shallow depth of field, dramatic lighting, high-tech atmosphere, photorealistic, 8k resolution, unreal engine 5 style --ar 16:9
```

### 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
**Concept:** A clean, metaphorical representation of "state validation." It shows infrastructure components (servers, databases) as stylized 3D blocks connected by pipelines, with a glowing scanner or "quality gate" turning them green to signify a passed test. This matches the "modern/clean" vibe perfectly.

**Prompt:**
```text
3D isometric render of a stylized cloud infrastructure platform, floating server blocks and cylinder databases connected by glowing data pipes, a soft green light scanning across the structure turning components from grey to bright emerald green, floating 3D checkmark icons, glass and matte plastic textures, soft studio lighting, pastel blues and greens, clean background, blender 3D illustration, octane render --ar 16:9
```

### 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
**Concept:** A symbolic representation suitable for a technical diagram. It contrasts "Code" (a script file) with "Reality" (a server icon), connected by a verification arrow. This is excellent for a highly professional, no-nonsense engineering blog post.

**Prompt:**
```text
Wide minimalist vector illustration, flat design, a split composition showing a code script icon on the left and a physical server stack icon on the right, connected by a process line with a central shield icon containing a checkmark, representing infrastructure validation, clean geometric shapes, corporate tech color palette of deep navy blue and vibrant mint green, white background, high quality vector art --ar 16:9
```
