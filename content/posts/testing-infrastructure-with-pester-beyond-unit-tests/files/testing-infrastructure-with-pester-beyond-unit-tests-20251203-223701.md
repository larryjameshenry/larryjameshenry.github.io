**Article Outline: Testing Infrastructure with Pester: Beyond Unit Tests**
**Title:** Testing Infrastructure with Pester: Beyond Unit Tests
**Description:** This article addresses the testing and quality assurance gap by teaching users how to leverage Pester not just for code logic, but to validate infrastructure states. It will differentiate between unit testing code and testing infrastructure within a DevOps context.
**Main Section Headings:**
1.  Introduction to Pester for Infrastructure Testing
2.  Setting Up Pester for Infrastructure Validation
3.  Writing Pester Tests for Infrastructure State
4.  Differentiating Code Unit Tests from Infrastructure Tests
5.  Integrating Pester Tests into CI/CD Pipelines
**Key Points to Cover:**
*   How to verify infrastructure deployment success using Pester.
*   Understanding the distinction between unit testing application code and validating infrastructure.
*   Practical examples of Pester tests for server health (e.g., service status, port availability).
*   Best practices for writing robust and reliable infrastructure tests.
