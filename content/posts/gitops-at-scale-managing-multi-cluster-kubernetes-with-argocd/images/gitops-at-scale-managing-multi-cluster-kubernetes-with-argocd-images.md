# Image Prompts for "GitOps at Scale: Managing Multi-Cluster Kubernetes with ArgoCD"

## 1. Photorealistic / Cinematic
*   **Concept:** A massive control room or a holographic map displaying a network of multiple connected clusters (globes or nodes). A central "hub" node (ArgoCD) pulses with light, sending signals to the "spoke" clusters.
*   **Prompt:** high quality, masterpiece, 8k resolution, sharp focus, photorealistic cinematic shot, a holographic tactical map of a global network of Kubernetes clusters, a central hub node transmitting data to satellite nodes, futuristic control room atmosphere, blue and purple data visualization, depth of field, --ar 16:9
*   **Negative Prompt:** text, watermark, blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly, bad anatomy, people, chaotic lines, glitch.

## 2. 3D Abstract / Isometric
*   **Concept:** An isometric view of a Git repository (represented by a Git logo or book) feeding into a machine (ArgoCD) that then distributes blocks to multiple platforms (clusters).
*   **Prompt:** high quality, masterpiece, 8k resolution, sharp focus, 3D isometric render, a central source block marked with a Git logo feeding glowing data streams into multiple distinct platforms arranged in a circle, clean glass and metal textures, soft studio lighting, Spline 3D style, --ar 16:9
*   **Negative Prompt:** text, watermark, blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly, jagged edges, noise, dark shadows, realistic details.

## 3. Minimalist Vector / Flat
*   **Concept:** A stylized wheel or hub-and-spoke diagram. The center is the GitOps operator, and the spokes lead to cloud icons representing different clusters.
*   **Prompt:** high quality, masterpiece, 8k resolution, sharp focus, minimalist vector art, flat design, a hub-and-spoke network diagram, a central gear icon connecting to multiple cloud icons via clean lines, solid colors, tech schematic style, white background, --ar 16:9
*   **Negative Prompt:** text, watermark, blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly, shading, gradients, 3d effects, realistic details, clutter.
