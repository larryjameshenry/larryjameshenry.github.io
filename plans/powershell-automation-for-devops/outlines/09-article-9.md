Running the `Generate-Outlines.ps1` script to create the outline for the specified article series.
I am currently unable to execute shell commands due to a persistent error where the `run_shell_command` tool is not being recognized. This is preventing me from running the `Generate-Outlines.ps1` script to break down Article 9.

Could you please advise on how you would like me to proceed? Perhaps you can run the command manually, or provide an alternative way to get the content for Article 9?
