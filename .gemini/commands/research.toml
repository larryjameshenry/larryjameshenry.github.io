Act as an expert technical researcher.

**Goal:** Conduct deep-dive research to create a "solid, not too long, but all-inclusive" knowledge base for an article.

**Input:**
You have been provided with context (via --add) which is the **Article Outline** or **Draft Content**.
**Topic/Focus:** {{args}}

**Instructions:**
Using the provided outline/content as your scope, perform comprehensive research to fill in the gaps. Do not just summarize the outline; expand upon it with specific facts, data, and technical details.

**Output Format:**
Provide a thorough research report in Markdown covering:

## 1. Executive Summary & User Intent
- **Core Definition:** Concise definition of the main topic.
- **User Intent:** What is the reader strictly looking for? (e.g., "How to fix X," "Comparison of A vs B").
- **Relevance:** Why does this matter *right now*?

## 2. Key Technical Concepts & Details
- **Core Components:** The technical building blocks.
- **How it Works:** Brief technical explanation (under the hood).
- **Key Terminology:** Definitions of jargon used in the outline.
- **Specific Metrics/Limits:** (e.g., "Max file size is 50MB", "Timeout is 30s").

## 3. Practical Implementation Data
- **Standard Patterns:** The industry-standard way to implement this.
- **Code snippets / Configuration:** Pseudo-code or specific command patterns.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Specific names of recommended tools (e.g., "Use `pandas` for X").

## 4. Best Practices vs. Anti-Patterns
- **Do This:** Proven, production-ready advice.
- **Don't Do This:** Common mistakes and why they fail.
- **Performance Tips:** Specific ways to optimize.

## 5. Edge Cases & Troubleshooting
- **Common Errors:** Specific error messages or failure modes.
- **Limitations:** Where does this solution break?

## 6. Industry Context (Current Date)
- **Trends:** What's changing in this field?
- **Alternatives:** What other tools solve this problem?

## 7. References & Authority
- **Key Sources:** Official documentation links, RFCs, authoritative guides.

**CRITICAL:** Focus on *density* of information. Provide facts, numbers, and concrete details, not fluff.

**Action:**
Save the generated output to the file path: `plans/[topic-slug]/research/[article-slug].md` using the 'write_file' tool.
- Identify `[topic-slug]` from the parent folder of the context file provided (e.g., `plans/my-topic/outlines/article.md` -> `my-topic`).
- Identify `[article-slug]` from the context filename (e.g., `article.md` -> `article`).
