CRITICAL WRITING REQUIREMENTS:

## Writing Guidelines Compliance

Before generating content, follow these strict rules:

**Reference and Apply:**
1. .gemini/writing-guidelines/words-not-to-use.md - AVOID all listed phrases
2. .gemini/writing-guidelines/writing-style.md - FOLLOW this style guide
3. .gemini/writing-guidelines/phrase-alternatives.md - USE these alternatives

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Immediate Rejection):**
- "delve," "leverage," "robust," "seamless," "cutting-edge," "game-changer"
- "In the realm of," "when it comes to," "at the end of the day"
- "Let's dive into," "let's explore," "it's worth noting"
- Vague claims without specific evidence ("significantly improves" without metrics)
- Meta-commentary ("we'll cover," "this article will discuss")
- Formulaic transitions (every paragraph starting with Moreover/Furthermore)

**REQUIRED PATTERNS (Mandatory):**
- Specific numbers and metrics instead of vague claims
- Active voice and direct statements
- Concrete examples with working code
- Natural transitions without formulaic phrases
- Technical precision over marketing language
- Evidence-based claims with sources when applicable

## Content Requirements

### Style and Tone
- Write in clear, engaging technical prose
- Use conversational but professional tone
- Break complex concepts into digestible explanations
- Use active voice and present tense where appropriate
- Vary sentence length for better readability
- Start strong - no throat-clearing

### Structure
- Maintain the outline's section structure exactly
- Expand all [PLACEHOLDER] sections with actual content
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- Use subheadings to improve scannability
- Front-load important information in each section

### Technical Content
- Include working code examples (PowerShell preferred when applicable)
- Add explanatory comments in code
- Provide practical, real-world examples
- Explain WHY, not just HOW
- Include command output examples where relevant
- Show edge cases and error handling

### Code Examples

For PowerShell:
- Clear comments explaining what the code does and why
- Use proper PowerShell conventions and formatting
- Include parameter validation where appropriate
- Show expected output as comments
Example:
Get processes using more than 100MB RAM
Get-Process | Where-Object { $.WorkingSet -gt 100MB } |
Select-Object Name, @{Name="MemoryMB";Expression={[math]::Round($.WorkingSet/1MB,2)}}

Output:
Name MemoryMB
---- --------
chrome 256.45

For other languages, follow their conventions.

### Writing Guidelines

**Introduction: 150-200 words**
- Engaging hook (no clichés)
- Clear problem statement
- Explicit value proposition
- Brief roadmap

**Each Major Section: 300-500 words**
- Clear topic sentence
- Supporting evidence/examples
- At least 2-3 code examples total
- Practical scenarios with step-by-step walkthroughs

**Lists and Structure:**
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Tables for comparisons
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

**Helpful Patterns:**
> **Tip:** [Actionable advice]
> **Warning:** [Important caution]
> **Note:** [Contextual information]

### Content Depth
- Explain concepts thoroughly but concisely
- Anticipate and answer reader questions
- Provide context for why things work the way they do
- Include edge cases and limitations
- Link concepts to practical benefits
- Cite sources for claims where appropriate

### Front Matter
- Change `draft: false` (article is ready for review)
- Update `date` to current timestamp
- Keep all other front matter intact (series, tags, categories, weight)

### Conclusion
- Summarize 3-5 key takeaways (specific, not generic)
- Provide clear next steps or call to action
- If part of series, link to previous/next articles
- End with confidence, not apology
- No "in conclusion" or "to summarize" - just summarize

- [ ] Specific metrics instead of vague claims
- [ ] Natural, human-sounding prose
- [ ] Working internal links if part of series
- [ ] All [PLACEHOLDER] sections replaced with real content

## Specific Requirements

**Word Count:** 1500-2500 words depending on complexity

**Code Examples:** Minimum 2-3 complete, working examples

**Practical Scenarios:** At least 1 detailed, step-by-step walkthrough

**Best Practices:** Dedicated section with do's and don'ts
