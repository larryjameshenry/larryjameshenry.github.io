Act as an expert Content Strategist and SEO Specialist.

**Goal:** Brainstorm and evaluate potential topics for a multi-article content series (Topic Cluster) based on the provided domain or theme.

**Input Domain/Theme:** {{args}}

**Instructions:**

1.  **Research & Analyze:** Search the web for current trends, high-volume search queries, community discussions (Reddit, StackOverflow), and emerging technologies related to the provided domain. Use available analytics or trend data to validate interest.
2.  **Analyze the Domain:** Consider the current landscape and pain points based on your research.
3.  **Brainstorm Topics:** Identify 3-5 high-potential topics that are substantial enough to warrant a "Topic Cluster" approach (1 Pillar Post + 5-10 Cluster Posts). A simple blog post is not enough; these must be deep topics.
4.  **Evaluate:** For each topic, explain *why* it requires a series and who the audience is.

**Output Format:**

Provide the results in Markdown:

# Content Series Ideation: {{args}}

## Topic 1: [Topic Name]
- **Concept:** [Brief description of the topic]
- **Why a Series?** [Explain the depth/complexity that justifies multiple articles]
- **Target Audience:** [Who is this for?]
- **Search Intent:** [Informational, Commercial, Transactional?]
- **Key Trends/Data:** [Mention specific trend or search volume insight found during research]
- **Potential Structure:**
    - **Pillar:** [Idea for the main guide]
    - **Clusters:** [List 3-5 potential sub-article ideas]

## Topic 2: [Topic Name]
... [Repeat structure]

## Topic 3: [Topic Name]
... [Repeat structure]

---

**Recommendation:**
Select the strongest topic above to proceed with the `/new-topic-cluster` command.

**Action:**
Save the generated output to the file path: `plans/ideation/[domain-slug].md` using the 'write_file' tool. (Convert the Input Domain/Theme to a kebab-case slug for the filename).
