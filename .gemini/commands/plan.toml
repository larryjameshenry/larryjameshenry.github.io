Create a comprehensive content cluster plan for the following broad topic:

Topic: {{args}}

CRITICAL: At the very beginning of your response, on the first line, state:
**ARTICLE_COUNT: [number]**

Where [number] is the total number of supporting articles you're recommending (typically 8-12).

Then provide a strategic plan that includes:

## 1. Pillar Article Overview
- **Title:** [Comprehensive, SEO-friendly title]
- **Description:** What the pillar article covers (2-3 sentences)
- **Target Audience:** Who this content is for
- **Primary Keywords:** 5-7 main SEO keywords
- **Estimated Word Count:** 2000-3000 words
- **Purpose:** How it ties all supporting articles together

## 2. Supporting Article Breakdown (8-12 articles recommended)

For each supporting article, use this exact format:

**Article [NUMBER]: [Article Title]**

**Description:** [2-3 sentences about what this article covers]

**Key Points to Cover:**
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]
- [Point 4]
- [Point 5]

**Target Keywords:** [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4]

**Estimated Word Count:** 1000-1500 words

**Connections:**
- Links to pillar: [How it relates to main topic]
- Links to other articles: [Which supporting articles to reference]

**Target Audience Level:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]

## 3. Taxonomy Strategy

**Series Name:** [URL-friendly series name]

**Shared Tags (across all articles):**
- [tag1]
- [tag2]
- [tag3]
- [tag4]
- [tag5]

**Category:** [Primary category for all articles]

**Per-Article Unique Tags:**
- Article 1: [unique-tag1, unique-tag2]
- Article 2: [unique-tag1, unique-tag2]
- [etc...]

## 4. Internal Linking Structure

**From Pillar to Supporting:**
- Pillar → Article 1 (context: [when to link])
- Pillar → Article 2 (context: [when to link])
- [etc...]

**Between Supporting Articles:**
- Article 1 ↔ Article 2 (relationship: [why linked])
- Article 2 ↔ Article 5 (relationship: [why linked])
- [etc...]

**Link Flow Strategy:**
[Explain the overall linking strategy - hub and spoke, linear progression, etc.]

## 5. Content Progression

**Recommended Creation Order:**
1. [Article number/title] - Foundation article
2. [Article number/title] - Builds on #1
3. [Article number/title] - Expands scope
[etc...]

**Dependencies:**
- Article [N] requires Article [M] to be published first because [reason]
- Article [N] references concepts from Article [M]
[etc...]

**Publication Schedule Suggestion:**
- Week 1: Pillar + Articles 1-2
- Week 2: Articles 3-4
- Week 3: Articles 5-6
[etc...]

## 6. SEO and Marketing Strategy

**Primary Topic Cluster Focus:** [Main topic]

**Search Intent Coverage:**
- Informational: [Articles covering what/why]
- Navigational: [Articles covering how-to]
- Commercial: [Articles covering tools/comparison]

**Featured Snippet Opportunities:**
- Article [N]: [Type of snippet - list, table, paragraph]
- Article [M]: [Type of snippet]

IMPORTANT FORMATTING:
- Number articles consistently: "Article 1:", "Article 2:", etc.
- Keep numbering sequential without gaps
- Make the count clear and easy to parse programmatically
- Each article should be clearly delineated with the "Article [NUMBER]:" prefix

Format as markdown with clear sections. This will be used to generate individual article outlines.
