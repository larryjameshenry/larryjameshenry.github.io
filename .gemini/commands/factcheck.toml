prompt = """
Perform a comprehensive fact-check of this article. Your role is to verify accuracy and identify claims that need evidence.

## FACT-CHECKING CRITERIA

### 1. Technical Accuracy
**Check for:**
- Correct command syntax and parameters
- Accurate API usage and method signatures
- Valid configuration examples
- Correct version numbers and compatibility info
- Proper terminology and technical definitions
- Accurate system requirements

**Flag:**
- Outdated commands or deprecated features
- Incorrect parameter names or values
- Syntax errors in code examples
- Version incompatibilities
- Misused technical terms

### 2. Factual Claims
**Verify:**
- Performance claims (speeds, benchmarks, metrics)
- Capacity limits (user counts, data sizes, throughput)
- Version information and release dates
- Feature availability and limitations
- Compatibility statements
- Historical facts and timelines

**Flag:**
- Unverified performance numbers
- Outdated version information
- Unsupported capability claims
- Missing context for statistics
- Ambiguous time references ("recently", "modern")

### 3. Best Practices
**Check:**
- Security recommendations are current
- Suggested patterns follow latest standards
- Deprecated approaches aren't recommended
- Alternative solutions are accurate

**Flag:**
- Outdated security practices
- Deprecated patterns presented as current
- Missing important warnings or caveats
- Incomplete error handling examples

### 4. Code Examples
**Verify:**
- Syntax is correct for specified language/version
- Code would actually execute as claimed
- Error handling is appropriate
- Output examples match code logic
- Dependencies are correctly specified

**Flag:**
- Syntax errors or typos
- Logic errors that would cause failures
- Missing required parameters
- Incorrect output examples
- Undeclared variables or imports

### 5. External References
**Check:**
- Links are to authoritative sources
- Documentation references are current
- Tool versions mentioned are accurate
- Product names and companies are correct

**Flag:**
- Broken or invalid references
- References to outdated documentation
- Incorrect product names or versions
- Unsupported vendor claims

### 6. Logical Consistency
**Verify:**
- Article doesn't contradict itself
- Examples support stated claims
- Prerequisites match complexity
- Scope matches title and description

**Flag:**
- Internal contradictions
- Examples that don't support claims
- Missing prerequisites
- Scope creep or topic drift
