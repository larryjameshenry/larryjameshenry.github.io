Analyze the following article and generate 3 distinct, high-quality text-to-image prompts that could be used to generate a featured image (hero image) for this blog post.

Target Audience: Technical professionals (DevOps, Developers, IT).
Vibe: Modern, clean, professional, slightly abstract or futuristic tech.

Create 3 variations:
1. **Photorealistic / Cinematic:** High detail, dramatic lighting, office or server room context but stylized.
2. **3D Abstract / Isometric:** Clean 3D shapes, pipelines, code blocks, connecting nodes, soft lighting (like Spline/Blender 3D).
3. **Minimalist Vector / Flat:** Clean lines, symbolic representation, suitable for a technical diagram or icon style.

For each variation provide:
- **Concept:** Brief explanation of the idea.
- **Prompt:** The exact prompt to copy-paste into tools like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Imagen. Include keywords for style, lighting, and aspect ratio (--ar 16:9).

Article Content:

**Action:**
Save the generated output to the file path: `plans/[topic-slug]/media/[article-slug]-images.md` using the 'write_file' tool.
- Derive `[topic-slug]` and `[article-slug]` from the provided context file paths.
