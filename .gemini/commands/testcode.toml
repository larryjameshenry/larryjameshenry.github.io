prompt = """
Extract and validate all code examples from this article.

For each code block:

1. **Identify Language and Context**
   - What language/technology?
   - What version is implied or stated?
   - What's the purpose of this code?

2. **Syntax Validation**
   - Is syntax correct for the specified language?
   - Are all brackets, parentheses, quotes properly matched?
   - Are statements properly terminated?
   - Are imports/using statements present if needed?

3. **Logic Check**
   - Does the code do what the article claims?
   - Are variable names consistent?
   - Are all variables declared before use?
   - Is error handling present where needed?
   - Are there obvious logic errors?

4. **Common Issues**
   - Undefined variables or functions
   - Type mismatches
   - Missing error handling
   - Hardcoded values that should be parameters
   - Resource leaks (unclosed files, connections)
   - Security issues (hardcoded credentials, SQL injection)

5. **Output Validation**
   - If output is shown in comments, does it match what code would produce?
   - Are example values realistic?
